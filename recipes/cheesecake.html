    <h3>Description:</h3>

    <p>For a recipe with so few ingredients (cream cheese, eggs, sugar, sour cream, vanilla & salt), 
        it took a lot longer than you might think to develop the perfect version. I’ve shared a few cheesecake variations in the past, 
        including my No-Bake Cheesecake, but getting a perfected classic version took lots of testing. Finally, here we are.

        Oh, and we are skipping the water bath! I’ve always found them to be largely unnecessary with cheesecakes. 
        Cook yours on a low temperature and 
        follow my tips below and you’ll have a perfectly creamy and crack-less cheesecake without all the hassle of a water bath.
