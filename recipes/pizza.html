    <h1>Pizza</h1>

    <h3>Description:</h3>

    <p>Over the years, I’ve shared a number of homemade pizza recipes on the blog (see here, here, and here), 
        but never one from start to finish – crust & sauce included. In reality, though, we make pizza from scratch fairly often around here. 
        Why? It’s one of the few meals we 
        eat where we get to spend time in the kitchen together. 
        I do most of the cooking in our house, but when pizza night rolls around, both of us pitch in.
    </p>
    
    <p>I also love to make pizza when I entertain because, well, everyone loves pizza, and it’s customizable! 
        It’s easy to make different toppings to suit different tastes. 
        You can even get your guests involved in topping their own personal pizzas, so everyone has a hand in the final meal. 
        When Sub-Zero, Wolf, and Cove asked us to create a recipe that celebrates their philosophy of
         living deliciously, I thought immediately of homemade pizza and my shared time in the kitchen with Jack, friends, and family.
